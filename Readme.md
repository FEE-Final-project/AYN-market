- **Admin user management**: We will enable the admin to create, view, and delete other admin users. The admin will also be able to assign different roles and permissions to other admins, such as super admin, moderator.
- **Payment methods**: We will add more payment methods for customers, such as credit card for now there is only paypal method.
- **Address management**: We will allow customers to add, edit, and delete their addresses.
- **Recommendation system**: We will try to build a recommendation system for customers that will help them discover and purchase products that match their preferences and needs.
- **Coupons and discounts**: We will add coupons and discounts for sales and promotions. We will also notify customers of any discounted products in the market via push notifications.
- **Responsive design**: We will work on improving the responsive design of the user interface to make it compatible and adaptable to different devices and screen sizes.
